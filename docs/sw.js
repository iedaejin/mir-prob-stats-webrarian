/*
 * webrarian service worker
 * ========================
 *
 * Emitted into the built site by `webrarian::bind()` only when `_webrarian.yml`
 * opts in:
 *
 *     build:
 *       service-worker: true
 *
 * Why it exists
 * -------------
 * A webrarian site ships a multi-megabyte webR runtime (the engine under
 * webr/v<version>/) plus the vendored viewer bundle. On a host that can set
 * response headers, the `_headers` file that `bind()` writes marks those as
 * immutable and the browser HTTP cache does the work. GitHub Pages cannot set
 * custom headers at all, so this worker is the only way a returning visitor
 * there avoids re-downloading the runtime. It speeds up repeat visits; it
 * does not make the site work offline (webR's lazy file system also issues
 * HEAD requests, which this worker leaves to the network). When the option is
 * turned off, `bind()` ships a retirement worker (sw-retire.js) in its place.
 *
 * Cross-origin isolation - read before editing
 * --------------------------------------------
 * webR needs SharedArrayBuffer, which browsers only expose to a
 * cross-origin-isolated page: the document must arrive with
 * `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` and
 * `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`, and its subresources must be
 * CORP-compatible. A service worker is the classic way to destroy that by
 * accident, because a Response the worker *synthesizes* (`new Response(...)`)
 * carries none of those headers.
 *
 * This worker therefore never constructs a Response. Every reply is either
 *
 *   - the untouched Response returned by `fetch()`, or
 *   - a Response replayed verbatim out of the Cache Storage API,
 *
 * and Cache Storage preserves the headers a response was stored with - COOP,
 * COEP, CORP and Content-Type included - so a replayed engine asset is
 * byte-for-byte and header-for-header what the network served. When neither is
 * available the fetch rejection propagates so the browser reports it, rather
 * than being papered over with a synthetic error page that would drop
 * isolation for the document.
 *
 * Requests the worker does not recognize get no `respondWith()` at all, which
 * takes the worker out of the loop entirely and lets the browser fetch them
 * exactly as it would with no worker installed.
